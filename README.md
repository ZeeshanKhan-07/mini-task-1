### ðŸ”— What is Blockchain?

A blockchain is a distributed and decentralized ledger that securely records data in blocks, which are linked using cryptographic hashes. Each block stores a set of transactions, a timestamp, and a reference to the previous block. Once added, data in a block cannot be modified without altering all subsequent blocks, which ensures integrity and trust in the system. Blockchain is best known for powering cryptocurrencies, but its use cases span various industries.

### âœ… Real-life Use Cases
